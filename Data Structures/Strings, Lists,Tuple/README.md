# Indexing:
* Accessing any item in sequence using it's index.
* Starts with 0 for the first item. So **fourth element is 3 i.e [4-1]**
* Can be accessed using square bracket **[index_numer]**

For example. Consider the following example:

```python

# String
x = "surya"
print(x[3]) # output = y

```
